# DriveSafe
Drive Safe is an app that tracks your location. While the app is running, any messages you received will have an immediately reply of "Later. I am busy walking/jogging/driving" depending upon you speed. At the end of you trip you will receive a summary of the phone numbers who texted you and the locations you visted. In addition, you'll get your average speed and total distance.
